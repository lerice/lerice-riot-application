			<h1>My League Exper<span class="redletter">i</span>ence</h1>
			<p>I go by the name of <i>lerice</i> playing in Oceania's Summoners Rift, after I left my past identity of <i>LovelyNuts</i> behind when migrating from North America.
			I've been an active player ever since the start of season 1, with so many great memories from my first pentakill with Master Yi to playing countless hours of ranked 5's
			throughout the night, to my personal greatest achievement, reaching Diamond earliar last year. Me and my close group of friends were so dedicated and enjoyed the game so
			much as to even having a brief stint in a sponspored team (although that didn't last long), as well as placing top 16 in the <a href ="http://riot2013.aclpro.com.au/" target="_blank">Oceanic Season 3 online tournament</a>. We were
			literally 2 <a href="javascript:puiWins()">wins</a> away from competing at PAX Melbourne but ended up being blown away by our opposition.<br/><br/>
			
			I achieved gold in Season 1 and 2 (forever flaunting my <a href="javascript:puiGoldS1()">gold season 1 summoner icon</a>!), and finally broke into platinum near the start of Season 3 after being stuck at
			1800 elo for a rough period. Following the brand new opening of Oceanic servers in 2013, I was able to climb through the (arguably easier) competition and achieve 
			Diamond during late Season 3. Although I may have slowed down my playing pace as of recently (as time allows me), I am nearing ever so closely to my 1000th normal game 
			victory, a statistic that I may not take the most pride but belongs to me.<br/><br/>
			
			Please take a look at some of the highlights of my league experience (too cheesey to call it a career xD):</p>

	<div class="slide">
		<div class="info">
			<h1>My Passi<span class="redletter">o</span>n</h1>
			<p>I <i>love</i> watching people do what they are <i>good</i> at. I <i>love</i> watching pro players play the game, be it League of Legends, Dota 2, osu!, Legend of Zelda
			or any game. I <i>love</i> e-Sports, and gaming in general for that matter. I <i>love</i> learning from <b>example</b>, be it a player flaunting to the world a brand new champion or
			build competitively, or even as easy as reading a guide on how to play a champion I've never played before. I <i>love</i> theory-crafting and trying to maximise an output with
			minimal input, be it trying to get as much DPS as possible on an AD carry (sorry, Marksman) with ~12k gold or stacking as much CC as possible in a team composition without
			undesirable lanes. I <i>love</i> playing games and I play to be the best that I possibly can, never willing to settle for second best.<br/><br/>
			
			Most importantly, all these passions of mine don't only apply to gaming. I've been PC gaming of one sort or the other (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game" target="_blank">MMO-RPG</a>'s
			to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy" target="_blank">RTS</a>'s to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena" target="_blank">MOBA</a>'s) nearly all my life and 
			can't imagine living in this day and age without them. The thought of working with a big gaming company on something I am this passionate about has always tickled my pickle (not
			in the sexual way...), but nothing I have really had any huge thought about. Until now. Enter first-year university, where I am studying a whole range of units to try and figure out
			what I really enjoy doing. Out of the blue, something appeals to me. Programming.<br/><br/>
			
			Not any kind of programming. <i>Good</i> programming. Clean programming. Efficient programming. The thought that I can literally <b>construct</b> something from scratch, <b>complete</b>
			it and have it <b>function</b> properly had me astounded me and hooked. From simple <i>working</i> programs like bank account simulators to tic-tac-toe to dictionaries, I thoroughly
			enjoyed programming. Then finally I started working more with websites, and have never looked back.<br/><br/>
			
			Working at Riot as a Web Technology Intern (or perhaps a Software Engineer - if I'm qualified!) would be one of my greatest passions, not only allowing me to be closer to a part of 
			e-Sports, something I love, but I would be doing something I enjoy doing (web design!), with the people I want to work for the most (you guys!) - and that is almost too much to be asking for.</p>

			<h1>My Abili<span class="redletter">t</span>ies & Past Work</h1>
			<div id="sliderdiv">
				<ul class="bjqs">
					<li>
						<p id="firstpage">I have had a whole range of projects and websites to work on in the past three years of my studies, which make me to be (what I believe) perfect for this position at Riot.
						Initially starting with programming, I used extensively the three supposed 'core' languages: C, C++ and Java. Java was the very first language I picked up and it has been my
						favorite ever since (go to page X to see a small GUI program written in Java). Other programming languages that I've had experience with during my studies include Ruby, F# (god forbid :x),
						MATLAB, Mathematica and small snippets of Python and Haskell.<br/><br/>
						
						Moving on, it was only until my third year of univerity that I did my first unit centered around web-technology. Putting together HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, 
						MySQL/SQLite/PostgreSQL to create usable websites overtook my passion for programming as I had always fancied good website designs. I thoroughly enjoy browsing other creator's 
						websites and collecting ideas to make use of in my own, and with todays ever-growing internet, I am continually intrigued with web technologies and only hope that my interest
						will continue as well.<br/><br/>
						
						I find that I am equally as happy working alone or working within a team, confident in my own capabilities (and learning abilities) as well as group management and communication skills.
						I am <i>very</i> <b>big</b> on clean, readable code and documentation (or as we like to call it, 'production quality' code), where I find that I won't accept my own code unless it is 
						<i>readable</i> and	of self-considered high standard. I don't mind many personal preferences (such as bracketing single line if-statements, or having white space around equals signs), as 
						long as through out the code it is <i>consistent</i> and therefore more readable :D. Even in my HTML code I try to make as easily readable as possible. Please do have a look at some of my 
						source code and contributions on my <a href="https://github.com/lerice" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.<br/><br/>
						
						I am also a big believer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration" target="_blank">convention over configuration</a> in software/coding, which is why I 
						believe Ruby (on Rails) to be the greatest language to have in my pocket when applying for this position, as well as overall being the perfect framework for me to use to develop web 
						applications. Lastly I would love to highlight my ability or desire to complete work fast and on time, I find that when I have my mind set on a job I will work to get it done ASAP, and 
						have always found myself managing deadlines and time constraints with ease. Please click next (>) or select a page number below to browse through some of my past work.</p>

						This website was my team's solution to our client's needs (in a university course based on professional computing - we were each allocated <a href="downloadables/Booked_Hours_Eric.xls">60 hours budget</a>
