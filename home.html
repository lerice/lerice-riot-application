			<h1>My League Exper<span class="redletter">i</span>ence</h1>
			<p>I go by the name of <i>lerice</i> playing in Oceania's Summoners Rift, after I left my past identity of <i>LovelyNuts</i> behind when migrating from North America.
			I've been an active player ever since the start of season 1, with so many great memories from my first pentakill with Master Yi to playing countless hours of ranked 5's
			throughout the night, to my personal greatest achievement, reaching Diamond earliar last year. Me and my close group of friends were so dedicated and enjoyed the game so
			much as to even having a brief stint in a sponspored team (although that didn't last long), as well as placing top 16 in the <a href ="http://riot2013.aclpro.com.au/" target="_blank">Oceanic Season 3 online tournament</a>. We were
			literally 2 <a href="javascript:puiWins()">wins</a> away from competing at PAX Melbourne but ended up being blown away by our opposition.<br/><br/>
			
			I achieved gold in Season 1 and 2 (forever flaunting my <a href="javascript:puiGoldS1()">gold season 1 summoner icon</a>!), and finally broke into platinum near the start of Season 3 after being stuck at
			1800 elo for a rough period. Following the brand new opening of Oceanic servers in 2013, I was able to climb through the (arguably easier) competition and achieve 
			Diamond during late Season 3. Although I may have slowed down my playing pace as of recently (as time allows me), I am nearing ever so closely to my 1000th normal game 
			victory, a statistic that I may not take the most pride but belongs to me.<br/><br/>
			
			Please take a look at some of the highlights of my league experience (too cheesey to call it a career...):</p>

	<div class="slide">
		<div class="info">
			<h1>My Passi<span class="redletter">o</span>n</h1>
			<p>I <i>love</i> watching people do what they are <i>good</i> at. I <i>love</i> watching pro players play the game, be it League of Legends, Dota 2, osu!, Legend of Zelda
			or any game. I <i>love</i> e-Sports, and gaming in general for that matter. I <i>love</i> learning from <b>example</b>, be it a player flaunting to the world a brand new champion or
			build competitively, or even as easy as reading a guide on how to play a champion I've never played before. I <i>love</i> theory-crafting and trying to maximise an output with
			minimal input, be it trying to get as much DPS as possible on an AD carry (sorry, Marksman) with ~12k gold or stacking as much CC as possible in a team composition without
			undesirable lanes. I <i>love</i> playing games and I play to be the best that I possibly can, never willing to settle for second best.<br/><br/>
			
			Most importantly, all these passions of mine don't only apply to gaming. I've been PC gaming of one sort or the other (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game" target="_blank">MMO-RPG</a>'s
			to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy" target="_blank">RTS</a>'s to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena" target="_blank">MOBA</a>'s) nearly all my life and 
			can't imagine living in this day and age without them. The thought of working with a big gaming company on something I am this passionate about has always tickled my pickle (not
			in the sexual way...), but nothing I have really had any huge thought about. Until now. Enter first-year university, where I am studying a whole range of units to try and figure out
			what I really enjoy doing. Out of the blue, something appeals to me. Programming.<br/><br/>
			
			Not any kind of programming. <i>Good</i> programming. Clean programming. Efficient programming. The thought that I can literally <b>construct</b> something from scratch, <b>complete</b>
			it and have it <b>function</b> properly had me astounded me and hooked. From simple <i>working</i> programs like bank account simulators to tic-tac-toe to dictionaries, I thoroughly
			enjoyed programming. Then finally I started working more with websites, and have never looked back.<br/><br/>
			
			Working at Riot as a Web Technology Intern (or perhaps a Software Engineer - if I'm qualified!) would be one of my greatest passions, not only allowing me to be closer to a part of 
			e-Sports, something I love, but I would be doing something I enjoy doing (web design!), with the people I want to work for the most (you guys!) - and that is almost too much to be asking for.</p>

			<h1>My Abili<span class="redletter">t</span>ies & Past Work</h1>
			<div id="sliderdiv">
				<ul class="bjqs">
					<li>
						<p id="firstpage">I have had a whole range of projects and websites to work on in the past three years of my studies, which make me to be (what I believe) perfect for this position at Riot.
						Initially starting with programming, I used extensively the three supposed 'core' languages: C, C++ and Java. Java was the very first language I picked up and it has been my
						favorite ever since (go to page 7 to see a small GUI program written in Java). Other programming languages that I've had experience with during my studies include Ruby, F# (god forbid :x),
						MATLAB, Mathematica and small snippets of Python and Haskell.<br/><br/>
						
						Moving on, it was only until my third year of univerity that I did my first unit centered around web-technology. Putting together HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, 
						MySQL/SQLite/PostgreSQL to create usable websites overtook my passion for programming as I had always fancied good website design. I thoroughly enjoy browsing other creator's 
						websites and collecting ideas to make use of in my own, and with todays ever-growing internet, I am continually intrigued with web technologies and only hope that my interest
						will continue as well.<br/><br/>
						
						I find that I am equally as happy working alone or working within a team, confident in my own capabilities (and learning abilities) as well as group management and communication skills.
						I am <i>very</i> <b>big</b> on clean, readable code and documentation (or as we like to call it, 'production quality' code), where I find that I won't accept my own code unless it is 
						<i>readable</i> and	of self-considered high standard. I don't mind many personal preferences (such as bracketing single line if-statements, or having white space around equals signs), as 
						long as through-out the code it is <i>consistent</i> and therefore more readable :D. Even in my HTML code I try to make as easily readable as possible. Please do have a look at some of my 
						source code and contributions on my <a href="https://github.com/lerice" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.<br/><br/>
						
						I am also a big believer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration" target="_blank">convention over configuration</a> in software/coding, which is why I 
						believe Ruby (on Rails) to be the greatest language to have in my pocket when applying for this position, as well as overall being the perfect framework for me to use to develop web 
						applications. Lastly I would love to highlight my ability or desire to complete work fast and on time, I find that when I have my mind set on a job I will work to get it done ASAP, and 
						have always found myself managing deadlines and time constraints with ease. Please click next (>) or select a page number below to browse through some of my past work.</p>

						<p class="websitetitle">Club Process System</p>
						<p>A fully functioning prototype of an online system which allows members to enter tasks and information about how to plan events, together with dates of when those tasks should be
						e-mailed out automatically by the system. Members are able to check off tasks as they're done to enable the team to keep track of what still needs to be done.<br/><br/>
						
						This website was my team's solution to our client's needs (in a university course based on professional computing - we were each allocated <a href="downloadables/Booked_Hours_Eric.xls">60 hours budget</a>
						to work on this project), where I worked as the main developer - personally designing the entire GUI as well as a portion of the back-end database services. This website was created 
						using Ruby on Rails as the framework.<br/><br/>

						<p class="websitetitle">maido | Japanese Online Retailer</p>
						<p>A <i>mock-up</i> of a Japanese-based online retail store that will eventually sell products produced in Japan to the world via <b>e-commerce</b>. The  idea is currently
						in its proposal stages, where I decided to help spring the idea to life by creating a mock-up website to advertise the concept.<br/><br/>
						
						Although currently just a mock-up (with no database support), it contains many features found in current online website stores and the main design feature is the simplistic nature of
						the site, where by people all over the world (not necessarily tech-literate) will easily be able to use and navigate through the store. In the near future I plan to design a working
						prototype for this website using Ruby on Rails.<br/><br/>
						
						This was a fairly quick work project (totalling about 8 hours), using entire HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to construct the functioning skeleton for the website, with help of PHP to
						deploy it to Heroku.</p>

						<p>The <i>static</i> version of a simple survey creation and system, allowing users to create an online survey and have other users take the survey anonymously, where the 
						creator is able to view a report of results.<br/><br/>
						
						My team and I then worked on building a database driven application based on this website, also hosted on Ruby on Rails. The source code is marked as private (unfortunately - I wouldn't
						want to make it public as my university commonly re-uses project specifications) on	GitHub and the online hosted website itself was on a temporary university given server and hence 
						has been taken down. You may still view my self-made static website however.<br/><br/>
						
						Do keep in mind this was the very first HTML-based website I created from scratch, and hence being new I had not picked up many minute coding conventions. For my first attempt
						at a website I am quite proud of this still.<br/><br/>

						<p class="websitetitle">Graphics & Animation Project</p>
						<p>A 'scene-editor' that allows collection of objects to be arranged in a scene and various properties of hem to be changed, ie colour, shininess and texture.<br/><br/>
						
						This was a very enjoyable project and unit for me, as I am always interested in graphic (and website) design and learnt a lot about graphics libraries (this made use of OpenGL - 
						project written in C++). I feel adding this project into my 'past work' section would showcase a little of my desire and current knowledge of visual design - something important
						in web technologies. <br/><br/>
						
						No public GitHub source code unfortunately.</p>

						<p class="websitetitle">Tetris Solver - Artificial Intelligence</p>
						<p>While not in any direct way related to websites or web technologies, I did very much enjoy coding up an AI which would essentially 'play' tetris to the best of its abilities,
						with the goal to keep the height of the filled grid as low as possible (duh!). <br/><br/>
						
						Given the specific input of a list of pieces to be 'played' by the program in sequence, it would output the best (calculated) positions and rotations of those pieces. In the end
						however the program does not particularly 'play' Tetris extremely well (poor AI implementation), but the main point of adding this to this section was to highlight the clarity or
						'readibility' of my source code, something I am always proud of, which can be found again on my GitHub.<br/><br/>
